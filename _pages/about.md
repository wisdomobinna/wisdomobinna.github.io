I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University advised by Prof. Elissa Redmiles. I'm a member of the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). My interests are in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and security engineering.  I am supported by the [Fritz Research Fellowship](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/projects/fritz-family-fellows-program/) and the [Graduate Merit Scholarship Award](https://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support/merit-based-financial-aid/).

My current projects include AI content generation (authorship, ownership, artistic value of AI-generated content, LLM Refusals), security (DNS security and machine learning), and combating AI-generated harms. I hold a Masters' degree from the University of Sheffield with the [Allan and Nesta Ferguson Scholarship](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/international/fees-and-funding/scholarships/postgraduate/ferguson). I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations. For hobbies, this actually has evolved over time, the only constant part is that I read books, and spend the remaining time thinking about what I read.
