I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University advised by Prof. Elissa Redmiles. I'm a member of the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). My interests are in human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and security engineering.  I am supported by the [Fritz Research Fellowship](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/projects/fritz-family-fellows-program/) and the [Graduate Merit Scholarship Award](https://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support/merit-based-financial-aid/).

Current projects include perception of AI-generated Art(authorship, ownership, and artistic value), DNS security and machine learning, AI/LLM Refusals, and combating AI-generated harms. I hold a Masters' degree from the University of Sheffield with the [Allan and Nesta Ferguson Scholarship](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/international/fees-and-funding/scholarships/postgraduate/ferguson). I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt. I'm happy to chat with you about any related ideas. Feel free to reach out for any collaborations!

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations in Africa. For hobbies, this actually has evolved over time, the only constant part is that I read books, and spend the remaining time thinking about what I read.
