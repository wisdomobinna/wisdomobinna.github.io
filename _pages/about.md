I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University advised by Prof. Elissa Redmiles. I'm a member of the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). My current work examines content generated by intelligent systems and how we can leverage cues from these outputs to develop more efficient systems that are both user-centered and free from harm. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Sheffield and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations. For hobbies, this actually has evolved over time, the only constant part is that I read books, and spend the remaining time thinking about what I read.
