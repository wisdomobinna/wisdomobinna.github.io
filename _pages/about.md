I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University researching in the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). I am supported by the [Fritz Research Fellowship](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/projects/fritz-family-fellows-program/) and the [Graduate Merit Scholarship Award](https://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support/merit-based-financial-aid/). My interests are broadly in artificial intelligence and digital safety. My previous experiences applied computational methods such as machine learning and causal inference, and social science methods like qualitative interviews and large-scale surveys in domains like public health, online platforms, public services, and the media. I hold a Masters' degree from the University of Sheffield with the [Allan and Nesta Ferguson Scholarship](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/international/fees-and-funding/scholarships/postgraduate/ferguson). I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project in Africa, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations. For fun, I read books, and play soccer. (quietly learning Mandarin also).
