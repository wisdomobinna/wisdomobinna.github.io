I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University advised by Prof. Elissa Redmiles. I'm a member of the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). My interests are at the intersection of human-computer interaction and security engineering. My current work examines content generated by intelligent systems and how we can leverage cues from these outputs to develop more efficient models that are both user-centered and free from harm. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Sheffield and an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations. For hobbies, this actually has evolved over time, the only constant part is that I read books, and spend the remaining time thinking about what I read.
