I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University. I am supported by the [Fritz Research Fellowship](https://techandsociety.georgetown.edu/projects/fritz-family-fellows-program/) and the Graduate Merit Scholarship Award. I am broadly interested in Computer security, and privacy. I study the security and digital safety threats that emerge when people interact with sociotechnical systems. I completed a Masters' degree at the University of Sheffield School of Information with the [Allan and Nesta Ferguson Scholarship](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/international/fees-and-funding/scholarships/postgraduate/ferguson) where I also served as a research Fellow. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project in Africa, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working in data-centric roles within different media organizations. For fun, I read books, listen to the news with some music, and play soccer. (quietly learning Mandarin also).
