I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University advised by Prof. Elissa Redmiles. I'm a member of the [CS Security Lab](https://seclab.cs.georgetown.edu/). My current work centers on content generated by intelligent systems. I hold a Master's degree from the University of Sheffield and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served as a Fellow at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and contributed to the development of the UN's ODET 15-year plan on emerging technologies. I have served on the United Nations' COVID-19 research project and spent three years working in software engineering and data-centric roles within different media and software development organizations. For hobbies, this has evolved over time, the only constant part is that I read books, and spend the remaining time thinking about what I read.
