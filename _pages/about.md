I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at Georgetown University researching in the Security Lab. I am supported by the Fritz Research Fellowship and the Graduate Merit Scholarship Award. I am broadly interested in Computer security, misinformation, networks, and Natural language processing. I completed a Masters' degree at the University of Sheffield School of Information with the Allan and Nesta Ferguson Scholarship. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt.

Outside of research, I have served on the United Nation's COVID-19 research project in Africa, provided software solutions at the British National Health Service, and spent three years working with several media organizations in Africa. For fun, I read books, listen to the news with some music, and play football. (quietly learning mandarin also).
