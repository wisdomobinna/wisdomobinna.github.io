This paper explored the adaptive self-censorship strategies newsrooms have developed in response to escalating government interference and regulatory pressures in the aftermath of a crisis. We delve into the safety decision-making processes they engage in when dealing with AI/user-generated content, highlighting the careful balance they must maintain between professional integrity and external constraints. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how journalists navigate these challenges while striving to maintain a degree of press freedom.
