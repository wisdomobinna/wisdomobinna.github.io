As technology advances, the Real Estate sector, particularly in developing countries, faces challenges in trust, sales, and management. This paper presents a responsive web application model for an online Real Estate Service system that leverages data analytics and visualization to enhance decision-making. By implementing backend clustering and regression algorithms on test data from over 62 PropTech firms in Nigeria, the system provides insights that help clients, managers, and agents make informed decisions. The model, developed from an analysis of data from over 7,000 PropTech firms, addresses key areas like property search and agent trustworthiness. Findings indicate that increased data input improves system efficiency, making property acquisition safer and more tailored to user needs.
